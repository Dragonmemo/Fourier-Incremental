	"Prologue" : "You are at a party in an old castle, you want to smoke but forgot where is the way outside and wonder through the corridors. | Then you feel a wave of fresh air telling you that it might lead outside and follow it. After passing through a door you found out that didn't led outside. | The door closes behind you and you are left in the dark, in a room you don't know yet, with your lighter in your pocket.",
	"Chapter 1": "You use your lighter to try and take a look at the room you are now trapped in, the door where you came from semms like it never existed. | There is an old looking desk in the room with a book on it. When you open the book you do not understand what is written on it. | | When you try to take a closer look to the first pages with your lighter, characters seems to change shape and you are now able to understand what they say. They are some sort of instructions about gathering fire energy. | A note on the lower part of the page tells you there is a button located at one corner of the desk that will give you some sort of recipient."
